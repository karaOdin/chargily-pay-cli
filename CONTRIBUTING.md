# Contributing to Chargily Pay CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chargily Pay CLI! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Git
- A Chargily Pay account for testing

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chargily-pay-cli.git
   cd chargily-pay-cli
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up configuration**
   ```bash
   # Run the configuration wizard
   php chargily configure
   ```

4. **Test the installation**
   ```bash
   php chargily --version
   php chargily balance
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) for code formatting:

```bash
# Format your code
vendor/bin/pint

# Check formatting without fixing
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

### Testing

We use [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
vendor/bin/pest

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/ApiServiceTest.php

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

### Code Architecture

The CLI follows a service-oriented architecture:

- **Commands** (`app/Commands/`) - CLI command handlers
- **Services** (`app/Services/`) - Business logic and API communication
- **Exceptions** (`app/Exceptions/`) - Custom exception classes
- **Config** (`config/`) - Configuration files

### Adding New Commands

1. **Create the command**
   ```bash
   php chargily make:command YourNewCommand
   ```

2. **Implement the command logic**
   - Add constructor injection for required services
   - Implement the `handle()` method
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include progress indicators and user feedback

3. **Register the command**
   Commands are automatically registered if they extend `LaravelZero\Framework\Commands\Command`

4. **Add tests**
   ```bash
   php chargily make:test YourNewCommandTest
   ```

### API Integration Guidelines

When adding new API endpoints:

1. **Add method to ChargilyApiService**
   ```php
   public function newApiMethod(array $data): array
   {
       $response = $this->makeRequest('POST', '/endpoint', $data);
       return $response->json();
   }
   ```

2. **Add appropriate error handling**
   - Use `ChargilyApiException` for API errors
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Include suggested actions for common errors

3. **Add caching if appropriate**
   - Use caching for expensive operations
   - Respect cache TTL settings
   - Provide cache invalidation mechanisms
